title: Deploy To Azure Using Git Hooks and GitHub Actions
Getting Started:
  - Run the following command in your terminal from the repository you want to deploy => node Ourproject/main.js
  - Files/Folders created:-
    - A templates folder:- that will be used for getting the workflow file.
    - A give_inputs.txt file:- You are required to give the necessary inputs inside this file before starting with deploying your app.
    - A pre-commit hook:- This is present inside the .git/hooks folder (If you had any pre-exisiting hook with the same name, it gets saved as pre-commit.bkp)
    - A pre-push hook:- This is present inside the .git/hooks folder (If you had any pre-exisiting hook with the same name, it gets saved as pre-push.bkp)
    - An open_workflow_run file:- This is a JavaScript file which can be run after you are done with pushing your contents to GitHub. This will take you to the workflow run you triggered on the last push.
    - Apart from the files created, the .gitignore file is appended with the name of the files/folders so that no sensitive information is pushed to your GitHub account.
